# Backend Project

## Overview
This repository contains the backend code for a project combining functionalities from YouTube and Twitter. The server-side software is written in JavaScript using Express.js framework, with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose ORM for data modeling.

## Dependencies
- bcrypt
- cloudinary
- cookie-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- jsonwebtoken
- mongoose
- mongoose-aggregate-paginate-v2
- multer

## Installation
1. Install Node.js.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Create a `.env` file and add necessary environment variables (e.g., PORT).
5. Run the server using `npm start`.

## Project Structure
- **temp/public**: Public files directory.
- **src**: Source code directory.
  - **db**: Code to connect to the database.
  - **models**: Database schema definitions using Mongoose.
  - **controllers**: Functionality implementations.
  - **routes**: Route definitions to call controllers.
  - **middlewares**: Validation middlewares, authentication, etc.
  - **utils**: Reusable utility functions.
- **index.js**: Main entry point to connect to the database and start the server.
- **app.js**: Configuration settings for the Express application.

- Start the server using `npm start`.
- Access the API endpoints as per the defined routes.

## Professional Workflow
1. Understand the project requirements thoroughly.
2. Create a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive data.
3. Use a `.env` file to manage global variables.
4. Organize project files into appropriate directories.
5. Configure the running script in package.json.
6. Use nodemon as a development dependency for auto-reloading.
7. Develop controllers, models, routes, middlewares, and utilities.
8. Utilize Prettier for code formatting consistency.
9. Establish a database connection following MongoDB documentation.
